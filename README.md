Switchboard is an accessibility app for Android that allows users with a physical disability, motor impairment or limited dexterity to control their device with one or more switches.

As long as someone has the ability to physically operate a switch – almost any USB or Bluetooth device with some kind of button on it will do – then they can use it to completely control their device, including browsing the web and sending messages. Switchboard is simpler and faster to use than the built in Android switch accessibility functions, and is particularly good for entering text.

It can be used with a single switch (auto-scan), two switches (manual scan) or even more (extra switches can be configured to back, home, scroll up and scroll down). It's been tested mostly with single-switch operation so far, for use by the most impaired users where every switch press counts.

### What are the limitations?

* Android doesn’t currently allow accessibility services to click on everything. Most native apps work fine, but some may have features that can’t be accessed, especially games.
* Switchboard enables users to tap and scroll with a switch, but not currently to swipe or long-press.
* Devices are all a bit different, so in case of glitches please leave feedback and we'll try to make sure it works on yours.

### What’s different compared to the built in accessibility services in Android?

The standard Android switch access is functional, but can be a bit clumsy—especially for typing in text. In fact, this app began life as a personal project for a family member for whom the built-in accessibility functions weren't quite good enough. This app uses fewer clicks to get things done, and an optimized keyboard designed specifically for switch access speeds up text entry considerably.

### What hardware is needed to use it?

You can test this out with no special hardware at all, e.g. using the volume control buttons on the device; anything which Android recognises as having a key that can be pressed will usually work. For best results, use a switch which is comfortable for you. Switchboard has been tested with several USB and Bluetooth switches, buttons, keyboards and foot pedals; even the clicker on a set of earphones can often be recognised by the app and used as a switch for complete device control.
